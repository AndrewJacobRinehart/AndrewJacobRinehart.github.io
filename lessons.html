                <p style="grid-column: 1/3">
                    
                    I have been teaching the harp for 10 years now, to students of all ages, experience levels,
                    and interests from my home studio in Waterloo. I love teaching!         
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My teaching style takes a holistic approach, with an emphasis on creative musicianship, while working towards student's goals.
                    In lessons I utilize a mixture of free play, structured activities, technical exercises, and guided reflection. 
                    My students learn not just how to play the harp, but to understand music as a language and creative discipline. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As a teacher, I understand that everyone's journey is 
                    going to be different, but I insist learning should 
                    always be fun.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My aim is to empower students to play with their harp… 
                    whatever that means for them; be it classical 
                    repertoire, celtic tunes, pop song arrangements, 
                    or something entirely their own.
                    <br>
                    

                    </p>
                

                    <p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bolder;"> how lessons work:</p>
                    <br>

                        I teach out of my home studio in Uptown Waterlo. Online lesson options are also available. 
                        <br><br>
                        I offer <strong>weekly half-hour lessons</strong>, or <strong> one-hour lessons on either a weekly or bi-weekly basis</strong>. 
                        <br><br>
                        Lessons are booked one month at a time, for the same time each week. Commitments are only one month long. 
                        <br><br>
                        Some student’s prefer to bring their instrument to their lessons, but usually students will play on one of my harps.   
                        <br><br>
                        I am happy to help you find an instrument to get you started, and have a limited number of harps available for loan or purchase.
                    
                    </p>
