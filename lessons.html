                <p style="grid-column: 1/3">I work with students of all ages, experience levels,
                    and interests from my home studio in Waterloo.                            
                    Online lessons are also available

                    My teaching style takes a holistic approach, with an
                    emphasis on personal expression, and self direction.
                    Through free play and guided reflection, students 
                    learn music as both a language and a creative 
                    discipline. By working towards student's goals, and 
                    encouraging them to find their own unique voice, I 
                    put my students in the driver's seat of their own 
                    learning.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As a teacher, I understand that everyone's journey is 
                    going to be different, but I insist learning should 
                    always be fun.

                    Harp students learn how to play with their harpâ€¦ 
                    whatever that means for them, be it classical 
                    repertoire, celtic tunes, pop song arrangements, 
                    or something entirely their own.
