                    <p>
                            I am an interdisciplinary artist and music educator. I work with a variety 
                            of mediums including sound, circuits, found objects, and with additive and 
                            subtractive technologies like 3D-printing, and laser-cutting. I'm 
                            interested in the quiet, still, and under-observed nuances of daily life. 
                            I often engage the public through chance encounters, with whimsical 
                            installations that transform liminal spaces. Currently I am exploring new 
                            methods of engagement through the web, and in physical space. When I'm not 
                            working on my own creations, I'm nurturing budding creatives from my home 
                            studio, where I teach music through the harp, and creative technologies.
                    </p>
                    <br> 
                    <p>
                        I am grateful to reside on the Haldimand Tract, traditional lands of the 
                        Anishnaabeg, Haudenosaunee, and Neutral peoples, in what is now known as Waterloo.
