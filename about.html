                    <p style="margin-top: 0vh; font-size: smaller; font-weight: lighter; text-align: left;">interdisciplinary artist / music educator</p>
            
                    <p>I am a harp player, music educator, curator, and interdisciplinary artist, working with experimental events, installation, painting, and sound. 
                        Having previously used new technology as a cornerstone of my practice, I am now entirely skeptical of the digital, and its implications for our
                        physical, social, spiritual, and environmental wellbeing. These days I am looking to my Ukrainian heritage to redefine my practice, re-skill, 
                        and remember art making practices of the past that were fundamentally in harmony with Earth. My work is about having good relationships; 
                        with tools and materials, friends and neighbours, plants and animals, and, land and water. I also love squirrels and gardening, especially growing carrots.Â 

                      
                            When I'm not working on my own projects, I'm nurturing budding creatives from my home 
                            studio, where I teach music through the harp.
                    </p>
                    <br> 
                    <p>
                        I am grateful to reside on the Haldimand Tract, traditional lands of the 
                        Anishnaabeg, Haudenosaunee, and Neutral peoples, on what is now known as Waterloo.
